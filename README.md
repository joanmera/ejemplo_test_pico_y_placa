I controlled lot of regulations about the placa number with cars and motorcycles

first---
Cars allow you to upload format like this
AAA-0000
or 
AAA-000

because in the past old car placas used to be like the last, so in case of a old car the program does not have any problem

you can upload more digits than the allowed by the format
is mandatory to use:
--AAA at the beginning
-- "-" in the middle
--000/0000 At the end

you cant use numbers when it´s supposed to be letters and use letters when it´s supposed to be numbers

About the Date and Time
you have the possibility of check the days you have pico y placa in; the past, current days and future.

if you are outside the pico y placa time the program will tell you when your pico y placa starts so you are warned abour it


with motorcycles you can upload only this kind of format
AA-000A

is the only one in Ecuador 

same restrictions as before but in different positions 
no changes with the date and time
the main difference is how the progam analyze your placa, it uses a .lenght()-2 because of the last digit of motorcycles placa

Reminder
in both cases, cars and motorcycles you have the chance of check your placa before you star the proceedings.

that´s it have fun and you´re free to try new variants if your country needs something similar
